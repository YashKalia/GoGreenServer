**Personal Development Plan**

**Goal**

My goal is to become more proficient in Agile development. This is important because it is an essencial skill for future employment, and I shall consider it to have been achieved once my teammates and I complete the OOP project using it.

**General Plan**

I have some basic knowledge of Agile and Scrum, which I aim to improve by further reading and by putting it into practice with the project. I also believe that my core quality of discipline will help me with it because it means I will structure my work and follow-through.

I am confident that my teammates will contribute to my goal by helping me understand things about Agile and Scrum which I might find unclear and by also using Agile and Scrum whilst working on the project.

**Concrete Plan**

**Step 1**: Read more about Agile and Scrum<br>
**Step 2**: Discuss it with teammates<br>
**Step 3**: Organise the first Sprint and create the Scrum Board<br>
**Step 4**: Hold a Sprint Review

-What are two of your strong points?
I have a positive attitude and i�m persistent

-Do you have examples of this?
I can be very persistent in getting what i want or where i want to be. So i don�t easily quit something. An example would be studying for the courses within this study, without some persistency you won�t make it.
The same goes for a positive attitude. Sometimes a lot goes wrong or not  everything goes the way i planned it on the first try, that�s why a positive attitude is a necessary characteristic

- How is this point shown in a team?
It can be very helpful to have a positive attitude within a team, because this can help to motivate others when they aren�t feeling so positive. It�s also a good point, because in a team you have to adapt yourself sometimes and in this whole process a positive attitude is a plus.

- What are two of your weaker points?
I have a love for procrastination and can be introvert

- Do you have examples of this?
Sometimes work can be done right that moment, but I have a tendency to procrastinate till the last minute. I think being introvert speaks for itself. I think a lot, but don�t always express it.

- How is this point shown in a team?
I hope these points won�t be showing within my team. But if I really have to write an example down, it would be that my procrastination could be showing up in the team by waiting till last minute to finish stuff or whenever people talk about their ideas i could be really quiet.

- Can you make a�core quadrant�of this?

G�- Goal
- What is your learning goal during this course?
Gaining more programming experience but also learning how to work together on a big project with different people, who have different ideas.

- Why is this important to you
Because gaining programming experience and learning how to work together on a big project could be beneficial to me, now and later on in my career as computer scientist. I could also learn a lot from my teammates when it comes to programming.

- When will you have succeeded in achieving this goal?
Whenever  i finish and pass this course, together with my team, with success.

R�- Reality (Your current situation)
- Are you actively working on your goal?
At this moment we just started, so no, I�m not actively working yet on my goal.

- What is going well?
We got to know each other at the first day and I think working together on this project will be a pleasurable experience.

I think that my programming skills could use a LOT of improvement and maybe tips from my teammates.

O�- Options (Look at possible options)
- What are options you have to achieve your goal?
Being more open to correction and advice from people around me and actively work on my programming skills and teamwork

- Which option do you want to use the most?
The 1st option : being more open to correction and advice.

- What is stopping you reaching your goal?
My stubbornness, whenever i want to do something a certain way, it�s hard for me to listen to someone else and take their advice.

W�- Will (Motivation, plan of action)
- What are you going to do to reach your goal?
I�m going to try to be really active within this team with an open mind.

- When are you going to do this?
Right away, from the start of this course.

By being patient and offering me a helping hand whenever i get stuck with something regarding this project.

**Personal Development plan**
Strong points: structured workflow and communication skills. These features are relevant as the structure of the code is crucial for its quality and communicating with one’s team members can greatly enhance efficiency.
Weak points: difficulty in coordinating with teammates and visualizing ideas. These are relevant as I have to improve splitting tasks with other people and the visualization of their ideas is important not only for the graphical interface the project requires, but also for the concepts that lay underneath it.

**Goal**

Efficiently working as part of a team and maximizing the extent of my knowledge to benefit all members. This is important because it’s the foundation of a good team effort. I’ll hopefully succeed withing the span of the project.

I am currently working towards my plan although in the limited capacity in the beginning of the project, as there is more conceptual work to be done rather than practical, both of which could be improved upon.

The main option of achieving my goal is to be open and communicative with my teammates to make sure that we are all working towards a goal that we understand and agree with, channeling our work productively and avoiding arguments.

To reach my goal, I am going to ask both my teammates and our coordinator for feedback as necessary in order to better understand not only their perception and expectations, but also the places where my approach could be improved to fit the situation.

**Personal Developement Plan and Goals**

Step 1: Develop a goal
Strength: I am good at resolving conflicts between people. I listen to both sides of the story and try to come up with compromises and solutions that are most beneficial to all parties.
Weaknesses: I procrastinate, because of fear of not being able to complete my part of the work, I have a hard time breaking up a huge task into smaller goals and thus easily get overwhelmed by the workload.

Step 2: Create plan to achieve your goal
My goal is to learn how an actual project is completed and to experience working in and with a team. It is important to me, because I am really anxious and worried about my future, specifically how I will function in a  work environment. I believe if this project is a success it will lessen my fears about my future, and maybe even boost my confidence in my own abilities.
I am trying to complete everything and take active part in the project, I hope my motivation, dedication and work ethic will improve and I can learn self-discipline and other useful traits from my teammates.

**Name**: Pradhyumnaa Ganapathi Subramanian

**Personal Development Plan**

**Strengths and Weaknesses**

Strength: I am flexible in terms of my role in a team and I can adapt into any team composition, whether I am familiar with the team or not.
Weakness: I am passive which means that I don't really like to argue when the supposed team leader gives me work that isn't really my work (Work of another person but isn't completed) so work gets piled up for me.

**Goal**

I want to learn how to work cohesively in a group and also improve my communication skills especially with a team I am not very familiar with, along with learning to code efficiently and responsibly.
I also want to improve my time management skill. I want to improve these skills as working with a team will definitely happen for a future computer engineer so I need to perfect the skill of working with a team and also
managing my time efficiently as all work needs to be planned and completed in a timely fashion in a work environment. We did start working cohesively as a group, we shared our ideas for the application features and discussed
the possible rules and regulations that will be imposed on the team members. There's no real improvement needed so far :).

**Name**: Danila Romanov

**Personal Development Plan**

Strength: Flexible and able to adapt, so that others can do better. I'm also good at picking up new knowledge and learning how to use things.
Weaknesses: I get overwhelmed when there is a lot of work, and work better under stress and leave things until later. This isn't very helpful in a team environment.

Goal: I would like to work on my weakness, which I believe I would do by working with a plan, since our group would have one. This would let my tasks have multiple deadlines, letting me break up the work and not leave it until the end. I would benefit from more experience of working in a team.
