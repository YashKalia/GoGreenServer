**Personal Development Plan**

**Goal**

My goal is to become more proficient in Agile development. This is important because it is an essencial skill for future employment, and I shall consider it to have been achieved once my teammates and I complete the OOP project using it.

**General Plan**

I have some basic knowledge of Agile and Scrum, which I aim to improve by further reading and by putting it into practice with the project. I also believe that my core quality of discipline will help me with it because it means I will structure my work and follow-through.

I am confident that my teammates will contribute to my goal by helping me understand things about Agile and Scrum which I might find unclear and by also using Agile and Scrum whilst working on the project.

**Concrete Plan**

**Step 1**: Read more about Agile and Scrum<br>
**Step 2**: Discuss it with teammates<br>
**Step 3**: Organise the first Sprint and create the Scrum Board<br>
**Step 4**: Hold a Sprint Review

-What are two of your strong points?
I have a positive attitude and i’m persistent

-Do you have examples of this?
I can be very persistent in getting what i want or where i want to be. So i don’t easily quit something. An example would be studying for the courses within this study, without some persistency you won’t make it.
The same goes for a positive attitude. Sometimes a lot goes wrong or not  everything goes the way i planned it on the first try, that’s why a positive attitude is a necessary characteristic

- How is this point shown in a team?
It can be very helpful to have a positive attitude within a team, because this can help to motivate others when they aren’t feeling so positive. It’s also a good point, because in a team you have to adapt yourself sometimes and in this whole process a positive attitude is a plus.

- What are two of your weaker points?
I have a love for procrastination and can be introvert

- Do you have examples of this?
Sometimes work can be done right that moment, but I have a tendency to procrastinate till the last minute. I think being introvert speaks for itself. I think a lot, but don’t always express it.

- How is this point shown in a team?
I hope these points won’t be showing within my team. But if I really have to write an example down, it would be that my procrastination could be showing up in the team by waiting till last minute to finish stuff or whenever people talk about their ideas i could be really quiet.

- Can you make a core quadrant of this?

G - Goal
- What is your learning goal during this course?
Gaining more programming experience but also learning how to work together on a big project with different people, who have different ideas.

- Why is this important to you
Because gaining programming experience and learning how to work together on a big project could be beneficial to me, now and later on in my career as computer scientist. I could also learn a lot from my teammates when it comes to programming.

- When will you have succeeded in achieving this goal?
Whenever  i finish and pass this course, together with my team, with success.

R - Reality (Your current situation)
- Are you actively working on your goal?
At this moment we just started, so no, i’m not actively working yet on my goal.

- What is going well?
We got to know each other at the first day and I think working together on this project will be a pleasurable experience.

- What can use improvement?
I think that my programming skills could use a LOT of improvement and maybe tips from my teammates.

O - Options (Look at possible options)
- What are options you have to achieve your goal?
Being more open to correction and advice from people around me and actively work on my programming skills and teamwork

- Which option do you want to use the most?
The 1st option : being more open to correction and advice.

- What is stopping you reaching your goal?
My stubbornness, whenever i want to do something a certain way, it’s hard for me to listen to someone else and take their advice.

W - Will (Motivation, plan of action)
- What are you going to do to reach your goal?
I’m going to try to be really active within this team with an open mind.

- When are you going to do this?
Right away, from the start of this course.

- What is the first concrete step you can take RIGHT NOW?
I can start now by finishing this essay-like list and by attending all the labs and meetings.

- How can your teammates help you achieve this goal?
By being patient and offering me a helping hand whenever i get stuck with something regarding this project.

- Can you make an action plan with concrete steps to help you achieve your goal?
Yes, i can start by 1. Listening to others and their ideas 2. Actively programming at least 8 hours per week 3. Going to all the OOP project lectures.
