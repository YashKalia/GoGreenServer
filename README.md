**Personal Development Plan**

**Goal**

My goal is to become more proficient in Agile development. This is important because it is an essencial skill for future employment, and I shall consider it to have been achieved once my teammates and I complete the OOP project using it.

**General Plan**

I have some basic knowledge of Agile and Scrum, which I aim to improve by further reading and by putting it into practice with the project. I also believe that my core quality of discipline will help me with it because it means I will structure my work and follow-through.

I am confident that my teammates will contribute to my goal by helping me understand things about Agile and Scrum which I might find unclear and by also using Agile and Scrum whilst working on the project.

**Concrete Plan**

**Step 1**: Read more about Agile and Scrum<br>
**Step 2**: Discuss it with teammates<br>
**Step 3**: Organise the first Sprint and create the Scrum Board<br>
**Step 4**: Hold a Sprint Review
