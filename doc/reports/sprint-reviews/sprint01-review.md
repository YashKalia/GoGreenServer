<!-- An example of how you can do a sprint review -->

# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Setting up
A lot of us had problems setting up our environments, one of our members encountered problems with joining the project on gitlab and getting started due to not being in the country.

So far it appears we've resolved this issue.

### Problem 2: Lacking communication
We felt like our communication was lacking

We aimed to improve it this week.

## Adjustments from previous sprints
 - There have been no previous sprints

## Adjustments for next sprint
    - Planning better
    - Better work distribution
