Group 7 – Meeting 1

Team Members Present: 6/7 (Yash Absent)

Application Features:
•	Accomplishments (Trophies) for accomplishing certain things which adds to the points gained by the user.
•	Long term goals that only need to be accomplished one time by a user (Such as installing a solar panel).
•	Daily challenges that the user can complete which gives the user points each day after completing it (Simple challenges such as eating a vegetarian meal once a day or taking the public transport to work)
•	A general questionnaire that the user will have to complete at the start to get to know the habits of the user. (Such as “Is he/she is a vegetarian” and accordingly, change the daily and long term challenges)
•	The concept of authentication to uniquely identify a user and have the user add friends in the app to see the consumption of friends and bring a competition aspect into the application. (Third Party Application if possible, depending on complexity)
•	Discussed some parts of the GUI but not in detail.
